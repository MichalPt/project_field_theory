# Implementation of the CI method for He atom using iterative techniques
This project is a final exam project for the course "Field Theory Methods in the Theory of Many Particles" held at Charles University in Prague, Czechia, in the winter of 2021.

The main task was implementing the equations derived during the lectures and calculating the first excitation energies using the CI approach without any numerical integration. All the integrals had to be solved using the multipole expansion, the Wigner-Eckart theorem, and the arising iterative algorithm.

Further details about the project and the equations can also be found in the book Quantum Mechanics and Electrodynamics by Zamastil and Benda, 2017.
